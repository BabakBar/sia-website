## Narrative Strategy

**Core Thread (Option B with light C overlay):**

"I started by building advanced AI/ML models (Data Scientist), then built solutions/applications that use them (Solutions Engineer), now architect the entire platform that powers them at scale (Cloud Engineer)."

**Key positioning:** "I understand what Data Scientists need from the cloud because I was one."

### Continental Progression Arc

**R&D Data Scientist (Sep 2022 – Feb 2023):**
- Focus: Deep technical ML/data science work
- Message: Foundation - understanding the workload
- Keywords: Neural networks, predictive models, data analysis

**IT Solutions Engineer (Feb 2023 – Jun 2025):**
- Focus: Building solutions (AWS pipelines, RAG, SAP integration, full-stack)
- Message: Expanding scope - cross-domain solution delivery
- Keywords: Cloud automation, ML applications, enterprise integration

**Cloud Engineer (Jul 2025 – Present):**
- Focus: Platform architecture at scale (Azure, Databricks, multi-cloud, governance)
- Message: Strategic ownership - architecting platforms, cross-team enablement
- Keywords: Infrastructure architecture, FinOps, security, standards, platform ownership
- **Senior signals:** Governance, cross-functional leadership, decision-making, enablement

## Bullet Distribution (Pyramid Style)

**Continental:**
- Cloud Engineer: **3 bullets** (current role, senior depth)
- IT Solutions Engineer: **3 bullets** (breadth/solutions phase)
- R&D Data Scientist: **1-2 bullets** (foundation)

**Other Roles:**
- TechTalent-Lab: **1-2 bullets** (AI research, GCP)
- FANAP: **1-2 bullets** (enterprise scale, 7K+ users)

**Advisory:**
- Each: **1 bullet** (credibility, not space-heavy)

**Projects:**
- 2 repos with 1-line descriptions + GitHub link

## Content Principles

- **ATS-first:** Keyword-rich, single-column, standard headers
- **Quantified:** Include metrics where possible
- **Concise:** Tight bullets, no fluff
- **Senior tone:** For Cloud Engineer role - governance, standards, ownership language
- **Consistent thread:** Always building data/cloud platforms, increasing scale/responsibility
