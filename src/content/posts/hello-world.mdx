Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts on software engineering, AI, and cloud architecture.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **AI and Machine Learning** - Practical applications and lessons learned
- **Cloud Architecture** - AWS patterns and best practices
- **Developer Tools** - Things that make our lives easier

## Code Examples

Here's a simple example of what syntax highlighting looks like:

```python
def hello_world():
    """A simple greeting function."""
    message = "Hello, World!"
    print(message)
    return message

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
```

And some TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Post {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  date: string;
}

const posts: Post[] = [
  { slug: 'hello-world', title: 'Hello World', date: '2025-12-28' }
];
```

Stay tuned for more content!
